  START_SCREEN_UTOPIA: "Years ago we awoke from stasis pods on this word. Each of the 100,000 had no memory of who we are, where we came from, or where we are. Around us was a large facility, equipped with everything needed to house a large population, and supplies to keep us alive for some time. Outside the facility a barren landscape barely able to sustain life./n/n With no record in the computers of who we were we pushed on in order to figure out our mysteries, and to salvage this world. For the past 200 years, we have survived. In the last 50 years our population has begun to out step the facility's ability to sustain us. In the last 10 we have achieved FTL travel. We will reach out in hopes to survive, and in the hopes we can fix our world."

  # Events
  f7.12.name: "The Means are Green"
  f7.12.desc: "While most of [Root.GetHomeWorldName] is still baren and cold, the majority of Continent the Cartetaker facility is on is thirving. This is thanks to the recently fixed Climate Stablizers. While the spread of their effect do seem to be slowing, it is stable. Hopefully in time we can find a way to increase their spread."
  f7.12.a: "Tangiable Progress"

  f7.13.name: "Spring Cleaning"
  f7.13.desc: "The repaired Climate Stabalizers on [Root.GetHomeWorldName] have done all they can. In order to continue our recovery of [Root.GetHomeWorldName], we must reseach new methods of restoring our cliamte."
  f7.13.a: "Lets get to work"
  
  f7.15.name: "Put a Ring On It"
  f7.15.desc: "The light being put off by the damaged orbital ring above [Root.GetHomeWorldName] is simply not enough to encourage the large-scale growth of flora. In order to continue we must repair it so we can increase its output."

  f7.20.name: "Utopia Realized"
  f7.20.desc: "After many years of hard work we have finally realized our world's true potential. The planetary ring was restored, bathing us in its light.

  f7.20.a: "Amazing"
